Error Breakdown:

! [rejected] main -> main (fetch first)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/ISWARYA-hash8/namaste-react.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do not have locally.
ðŸ”§ Solution:
Run the following command before pushing:


git pull origin main --rebase
Then push again:


git push origin main
Why --rebase?
It integrates remote changes before your changes and keeps the history clean (linear), avoiding unnecessary merge commits.

In case of merge conflicts during pull:
Git will ask you to resolve conflicts manually. After fixing them:

bash
Copy
Edit
git add .
git rebase --continue
Then:

bash
Copy
Edit
git push origin main
